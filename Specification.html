	<h2><span id="1.0.0">Introduction</span></h2>

	<p>The Pok<span>&#233;</span>dex Encyclopedia is a third party database created for the access of information on Generation I pok<span>&#233;</span>mon. 
		The purpose of this application is to give pok<span>&#233;</span>mon players to more easily access a greater depth of information on pok<span>&#233;</span>mon that is not provided by the in-game pok<span>&#233;</span>dex, which is a guide to completion rather than the be all and end all. Vital information like base stats, in-game locations, type effectiveness, natures, and learnset is not provided. The Pok<span>&#233;</span>dex Encyclopedia strives to provide this information to allow the players to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game.</p>
	
	<h3><span id="1.1.1">Purpose</span></h3>

	<p>
		The purpose of this project is to provide pokemon players with a comprehensive database of relevant information to allow them to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game. 
		Specifically, how they can optimize their pokemon teams based on information our application provides. 
	</p>
	
	<h3><span id="1.1.2">Scope</span></h3>

	<p>
		We aim to have all 151 Generation I pokemon in our database, along with the following information which has already been provided by the ingame pokedex: name, description, type(s), height, weight, brief biography description. As well as additional information that is relevant but not provided in-game: abilities, catch rate, type match ups, leveling-rate, EV yield.
	</p>

	<h3><span id="1.1.3">Assumptions and Constraints</span></h3>
	<p>
		The biggest constraint on this project will be time. We have a set timeline to accomplish the objectives we have declared. Furthermore, our understanding of the software we have available to us may be another limitation. It's possible that members will have to learn how to use this software before being able to implement the objectives. Another constraint is acquiring Pokémon data. We will need to find a source with all this information, otherwise entering this information in manually will be repetitive.
	</p>

	<h2><span id="3.0">Definitions</span></h2>

	<u><b>Type</b></u>: types are properties for Pokémon and their moves. A pokemon may have one or two types. A move has exactly one type. The type of a damaging move typically defines which types of Pokémon it is super effective against, which types of Pokémon it is not very effective against, and which types of Pokémon it is completely ineffective against
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Abilities</b></u>: An Ability is a game mechanic that provides a passive effect in battle or in the overworld. Individual Pokémon may have only one Ability at a time. Not every Ability is entirely beneficial; some of them are hindering.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Catch rate</b></u>: Each species of Pokémon has a catch rate that applies to all its members. When a Poké Ball is thrown at a wild Pokémon, the game uses that Pokémon's catch rate in a formula to determine the chances of catching that Pokémon. Higher catch rates mean that the Pokémon is easier to catch, up to a maximum of 255.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Type matchup chart</b></u>: A type chart, also known as type matchup chart, shows which modifiers are applied to move types when attacking Pokémon of each type. 
	Leveling-rate
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>EV yield</b></u>: When a Pokémon is defeated in battle, it will give effort values to the Pokémon that participated in the battle against it. 
	

	<h2><span id="4.0">Project Organization</span></h2>
	<h3><span id="4.1">Product Perspective</span></h3>
	<P>
		There will be two major components to this application, front-end and back-end.<br><br>
		Front-end will deal with the user experience/interface. The goal is to create a GUI that is pleasant and easy to use. The GUI will be appealing; images of the Pokémon will be included as well as having the text information placed appropriately. Ideally we would like to have a search function that will be able to communicate with the backend.<br><br>
		Back-end will deal with the information stored in the database. The goal will be to create a comprehensive database with all the information that we would like to have for each Pokémon object. The objects in this database will remain static; unless we make plans to add further generations of Pokémon to this project, we will not have features to add new Pokémon. Clean information retrieval is key to this project. <br>
