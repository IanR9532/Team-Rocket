    <h2><span id="1.0">(1.0) Introduction</span></h2>
    <h3><span id="1.1">(1.1) Purpose</span></h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to provide Pokémon players with a comprehensive database of relevant information
        which will allow them to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game. Specifically, how they
        can optimize their Pokémon teams based on information our application provides.
    </p>

    <h3><span id="1.2">(1.2) Scope</span></h3>
    <p>
        We aim to have all 151 generation I Pokémon in our database, along with the following information which has
        already been provided by the ingame Pokédex: name, description, type(s), height, weight, brief biography
        description, and location. As well as additional information that is relevant but not provided in-game:
        abilities, catch rate, type match ups, leveling-rate, and EV yield. We would also like to have a user account
        system using a password hashing algorithm to store passwords. Users will be able to save information to their
        account.
    </p>

    <h3><span id="1.3">(1.3) Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations</span></h3>
    <u><b>Move</b></u>: A move, also known as an attack is the skill Pokémon primarily use in battle.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Type</b></u>: Pokémon and the different moves they can use are all classified by properties called Types. A
    Pokémon can be associated with one or two types whereas a move can only be associated with one type. Moves that deal
    damage to other Pokémon can have more of an effect, a neutral level of effectiveness, less of an effect, or no
    effect at all, based on their type and the type of the Pokémon they are being used against. An example of an
    effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move against a Grass type Pokémon. An example of a less
    effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move against a Water type Pokémon. Finally, an example of a move
    which would have no effect at all would be a Ghost type move being used against a Normal type Pokémon.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Abilities</b></u>: An Ability is a game mechanic that provides a passive effect in battle or in the overworld.
    Individual Pokémon may have only one Ability at a time. Not every Ability is entirely beneficial; some of them are
    hindering.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Catch rate</b></u>: Each species of Pokémon has a catch rate that applies to all its members. When a Poké Ball
    is thrown at a wild Pokémon, the game uses that Pokémon's catch rate in a formula to determine the chances of
    catching that Pokémon. Higher catch rates mean that the Pokémon is easier to catch, up to a maximum of 255.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Type matchup chart</b></u>: A type chart, also known as type matchup chart, shows which modifiers are applied
    to move types when attacking Pokémon of each type.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>EV yield</b></u>: When a Pokémon is defeated in battle, it will give effort values to the Pokémon that
    participated in the battle against it.

    <h3><span id="1.5">(1.5) Overview</span></h3>
    <p>
        The Pokémon Encyclopedia(“the project”, “the software”) is a third party database created for the access of
        information on generation I Pokémon. The purpose of this application is to give Pokémon players access to a
        greater depth of information on Pokémon that is not provided by the in-game Pokédex. This encyclopedia will be a
        guide for players who aims for completion rather than the be all and end all. Vital information like base stats,
        in-game locations, type effectiveness, natures, and learnset is not provided by other online encyclopedias. The
        Pokémon Encyclopedia strives to provide this information to allow the players to make educated decisions on how
        they would like to play the game.
    </p>

    <h2><span id="2.0">(2.0) Overall description</span></h2>
    <h3><span id="2.1">(2.1) Product perspective</span></h3>
    <p>
        The Pokémon Encyclopedia is a desktop program that provides an easily accessible database for information on all
        Pokémon in generation I. This will allow users to make educated and informed decisions on how they would like to
        play the game.
    </p>

    <h3><span id="2.2">(2.2) Product Functions</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Look up specific Pokémon and return their stats, moves, type, etc.</li>
        <li>Side by side compare Pokémon stats with other Pokémon</li>
        <li>Calculate damage against other Pokémon</li>
        <li>List where specific Pokémon can be found in-game</li>
        <li>Have a user system where users can save information</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span id="2.3">(2.3) User Characteristics</span></h3>
    <p>
        The intended users of our product will be all users of all ages and of all technical experience that are
        interested in Pokémon
    </p>

    <h3><span id="2.4">(2.4) Constraints</span></h3>
    <p>
        There will be no cost constraints. The only constraints that we predict to encounter will be development
        constraints.These include time and possible reliability constraints depending on which apis or frameworks we
        utilize. Furthermore, team members will be expected to learn how to use the software or any additional knowledge
        that they may need to complete the tasks they are responsible for.
    </p>

    <h3><span id="2.5">(2.5) Assumptions and Dependencies</span></h3>

    <h2><span id="3.0">(3.0) Specific requirements</span></h2>

    <h3><span id="3.1">(3.1) Functions</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Validity checks. Did the user enter the name of the Pokémon correctly? If not, handle this error.</li>
        <li>Entry of new objects into the database must be valid. They must contain the attributes of a Pokémon object
            mentioned below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span id="3.2">(3.2) Security</span></h3>
    <p>
        Users will be able to create accounts. They will be able to store information like their favourite Pokémon, and
        add Pokémon to the database. Their login password will be stored encrypted using a hashing algorithm to ensure
        that their information is secure.
    </p>

    <h3><span id="3.3">(3.3) Objects</span></h3>
    <p>
        Pokémon objects will be primarily what is stored in the database. This will contain the information previously
        mentioned. Name, description, type(s), height, weight, brief biography description, location, abilities, catch
        rate, type match ups, leveling-rate, and EV yield are all the attributes that we would currently like the
        Pokémon objects to have
    </p>

    <h3><span id="3.4">(3.4) Features</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>3.4.1</b> Searching for a specific Pokémon
            <ul>
                <li>There are many Pokémon in generation I. Users may not want to spend time searching for their desired
                    Pokémon through the list, rather it would be much convenient for them to be able to search up the
                    Pokémon name and have the information show up.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>3.4.2</b> Comparing two Pokémon
            <ul>
                <li>The Pokémon Encyclopedia allows users to look up Pokémon and see the information related to that
                    Pokémon. There may be times when the users want to compare the Pokémon so they can make an informed
                    decision on which Pokémon they want to use.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>3.4.3</b> Letting users save information on their account
            <ul>
                <li>We understand that the users may want to use the information they look up again later on and it
                    would be inconvenient for them to look up the information all over again, so we provide them with a
                    way to save the information through their accounts. </li>
