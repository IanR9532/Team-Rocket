    <h2><span id="1.0">(1.0) Introduction</span></h2>
    <h3><span id="1.1">(1.1) Purpose</span></h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to provide Pokémon players with a comprehensive database of relevant information to allow them to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game. Specifically, how they can optimize their Pokémon teams based on information our application provides. 
    </p>

    <h3><span id="1.2">(1.2) Scope</span></h3>
    <p>
        We aim to have all 151 Generation I Pokémon in our database, along with the following information which has already been provided by the ingame Pokédex: name, description, type(s), height, weight, brief biography description. As well as additional information that is relevant but not provided in-game: abilities, catch rate, type match ups, leveling-rate, EV yield. As well, we would like to have a user account system using a password hashing algorithm to store passwords. Users will be able to save information to their account. 
    </p>

    <h3><span id="1.3">(1.3) Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations</span></h3>
	<u><b>Move</b></u>: A move, also known as an attack is the skill Pokémon primarily use in battle.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Type</b></u>: Pokémon and the different moves they can use are all classified by properties called Types. A Pokémon can be associated with one or two types whereas a move can only be associated with one type. Moves that deal damage to other Pokémon can have more of an effect, a neutral level of effectiveness, less of an effect, or no effect at all, based on their type and the type of the Pokémon they are being used against. An example of an effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move against a Grass type Pokémon. An example of a less effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move against a Water type Pokémon. Finally, an example of a move which would have no effect at all would be a Ghost type move being used against a Normal type Pokémon.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Abilities</b></u>: An Ability is a game mechanic that provides a passive effect in battle or in the overworld. Individual Pokémon may have only one Ability at a time. Not every Ability is entirely beneficial; some of them are hindering.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Catch rate</b></u>: Each species of Pokémon has a catch rate that applies to all its members. When a Poké Ball is thrown at a wild Pokémon, the game uses that Pokémon's catch rate in a formula to determine the chances of catching that Pokémon. Higher catch rates mean that the Pokémon is easier to catch, up to a maximum of 255.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Type matchup chart</b></u>: A type chart, also known as type matchup chart, shows which modifiers are applied to move types when attacking Pokémon of each type. 
	<br>
	<br>
    <u><b>EV yield</b></u>: When a Pokémon is defeated in battle, it will give effort values to the Pokémon that participated in the battle against it.

    <h3><span id="1.5">(1.5) Overview</span></h3>
    <p>
        The Pokédex Encyclopedia(“the project”, “the software”) is a third party database created for the access of information on Generation I Pokémon. The purpose of this application is to give Pokémon players access to a greater depth of information on Pokémon that is not provided by the in-game Pokédex. This encyclopedia will be a guide for players who aims for completion rather than the be all and end all. Vital information like base stats, in-game locations, type effectiveness, natures, and learnset is not provided by other online encyclopedias. The Pokédex Encyclopedia strives to provide this information to allow the players to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game.
