        <h2><b><u>Entity Objects</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            There are two primary entity objects identified using noun-extraction. The project will store information
            about ‘first generation’ Pokémon and any teams created by the user
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Pokémon: the entity object that stores information about each Pokémon. It will allow Pokémon to be added
                to teams, to enable the user to easily see information about the Pokémon in one place, and to allow
                comparison between two Pokémon species. All attributes are set when entered into the database and
                immutable (unless changed at an administrative level inside the database).
                <p>Attributes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Name (string):</b> the name of the Pokémon</li><br>
                    <li><b>HP (integer):</b> the base health statistic*</li><br>

                    <li><b>Special Defense (integer):</b> the base strength of the Pokémon’s special defense move*</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Speed (integer):</b> the base speed statistic*</li><br>
                    <li><b>Evolve Level (integer):</b> the level at which the Pokémon evolves into a different Pokémon
                        (the
                        value is NULL if it does not have an evolve level)</li><br>
                    <li><b>Location(s) (string):</b> the location or locations where the Pokémon can be found in the
                        game</li>

                    <li><b>Type (string):</b> the Pokémon type statistic (water, fire, grass, rock, etc.)</li><br>
                    <li><b>Effectiveness (array):</b> an array of all the strengths and weaknesses of a particular
                        Pokémon when
                        fetched from the database.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    *Each Pokémon species has a base level of HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, and Speed
                    regardless of the moves they have and level that they are.

            <br>
            <li>
                Team: the entity object that stores information about a Pokémon team (of max 6 Pokémon to match the
                in-game team size) that has been created. It enables the user to retrieve teams that they have created
                and saved earlier and then to make changes to them. All attributes in the team entity project are set
                when the user saves the team that has been created.

                User: the profile for the user that tracks their information. Is created by the user when they sign up
                to use the web application. Information is updated by them at their convenience (except their user ID
                which will not change).
                <p>Attributes:</p>

        <h2><b><u>Boundary Objects</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Each boundary option has two sections to it. What details the information that the object must be input by
            the user and/or the information that will be presented to the user. How is a broad explanation on how the
            information will be presented and/or the action required from the user to obtain the information necessary.
        </p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Log-in:</li>
            <p class="Tab-over">
                <i>What:</i> The log-in menu will be used to record the user credentials and to identify the particular
                user. It will require two pieces of information from the user: the user ID and the password. If the
                credentials provided are not associated with a recorded user, an error message should pop up and ask for
                different credentials. Additionally, if the user forgets log-in password, the web page will direct the
                user to the help centre, where the user can reset the password through texts or emails.
                <br><br>
                <i>How:</i> The user will type in the information. The error message and help centre will be a separate
                window.
            </p>
            <li>Registration:</li>
            <p class="Tab-over">
                <i>What:</i> Presents the user with an option to register a new account. When a user attempts to create
                an account that already exists (based on the email being used), an error message will be displayed to
                indicate the registration failure. Another error message will be displayed if the information provided
                does not satisfy the requirements (e.g. username minimum/maximum lengths, etc.).
                <br><br>
                <i>How:</i> The user will type in information. The error message(s) will pop up in a separate window.
            </p>
            <li>Home:</li>
            <p class="Tab-over">
                <i>What:</i> It will present the user with four options that they can be directed to: the search option,
                saved Pokémon, saved teams, and comparisons.
                <br><br>
                <i>How:</i> The object should have four buttons, corresponding to each of the above options, that the
                user can click.
            </p>

            <li>Search:</li>
            <p class="Tab-over">
                <i>What:</i> The user must input the name of a Pokémon that they want to search. The Pokémon that
                matches the search will be presented to the user and the user will be prompted to view this Pokémon or
                search again. However, if the Pokémon is not found, the search will return none and prompt an error
                message - “There is no matching result”.
                <br><br>
                <i>How:</i> The user will type in the information.
            </p>

            <li>Profile:</li>
            <p class="Tab-over">
                <i>What:</i> The profile boundary object presents the user with all of the statistics in the Pokémon
                entity object (Name, HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Evolve Level,
                Location(s), Type) and a photo of the Pokémon.

                <i>What:</i> A list of the Pokémon that the user has chosen to save or favorite for future quick lookup.
                <br><br>
                <i>How:</i> A list of the names of the Pokémon, sorted alphabetically.
            </p>

            <li>Comparison:</li>
            <p class="Tab-over">
                <i>What:</i> The user must input which two Pokémon will be compared and then the user is presented with
                statistics (Name, HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Evolve Level,
                Location(s), Type) from two Pokémon and their photos respectively. Should the user input two of the same
                Pokémon, they will receive a warning/error message stating that “The two Pokémon are the same,” and the
                program will only display one copy of the data.
                <br><br>
                <i>How:</i> In a table, similar to the Profile object.

            <p class="Tab-over">
                <i>What:</i> Allows users to create teams and presents the user with a list of teams, up to three, that
                they have created. Users are not able to create more than three teams and if they try to, an error
                message will pop up to inform them that three teams at maximum is the rule.

                <i>What:</i> Presents the user with the information on a team, including a team name and Pokémon in the
                team. The user can input Pokémon that they would like to place on the team in an empty slot or to
                replace a team member. However, each team is only allowed to input up to six Pokémon, any member who
                attempts to input more than 6 Pokémon will be prompted with an error message- “You’ve reached the
                maximum limit of Pokémon in a team, this Pokémon cannot be added.”
                <br><br>
                <i>How:</i> The user will be able to click on slots and choose from a list. The slots will be presented
                to the user with six slots organized into two rows.
