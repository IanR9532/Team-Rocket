        <h2><b><u>Entity Objects</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            There are two primary entity objects identified using noun-extraction. The project will store information about ‘first generation’ Pokemon and any teams created by the user
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Pokemon: the entity object that stores information about each Pokemon. It will allow Pokemon to be added to teams, to enable the user to easily see information about the Pokemon in one place, and to allow comparison between two Pokemon species. All attributes are set when entered into the database and immutable (unless changed at an administrative level inside the database).
                <p>Attributes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name (string): the name of the Pokemon</li><br>
                    <li>HP (integer): the base health statistic*</li><br>
                    <li>Attack (integer): the base attack statistic*</li><br>
                    <li>Defense (integer): the base defense statistic*</li><br>
                    <li>Special Attack (integer): the base strength of the Pokemon’s special attack*</li><br>
                    <li>Special Defense (integer): the base strength of the Pokemon’s special defense move*</li><br>
                    <li>Speed (integer): the base speed statistic*</li><br>
                    <li>Evolve Level (integer): the level at which the Pokemon evolves into a different Pokemon (the value is NULL if it does not have an evolve level)</li><br>
                    <li>Location(s) (string): the location or locations where the Pokemon can be found in the game</li><br>
                    <li>Type (string): the Pokemon type statistic (water, fire, grass, rock, etc.)</li><br>
                    <li>Effectiveness (array): an array of all the strengths and weaknesses of a particular pokemon when fetched from the database.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    *Each Pokemon species has a base level of HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, and Speed regardless of the moves they have and level that they are.

            <li>
                Team: the entity object that stores information about a Pokemon team (of max 6 Pokemon to match the in-game team size) that has been created. It enables the user to retrieve teams that they have created and saved earlier and then to make changes to them. All attributes in the team entity project are set when the user saves the team that has been created.
                <p>Attributes:</p>

        <h2><b><u>Boundary Objects</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Each boundary option has two sections to it. What details the information that the object must be input by the user and/or the information that will be presented to the user. How is a broad explanation on how the information will be presented and/or the action required from the user to obtain the information necessary.
        </p>

        <ol type="1">

                    <i>What:</i> The log-in menu will be used to record the user credentials and to identify the particular user. It will require two pieces of information from the user: the user ID and the password. If the credentials provided are not associated with a recorded user, an error message should pop up and ask for different credentials. Additionally, if the user forgets log-in password, the web page will direct the user to the help centre, where the user can reset the password through texts or emails.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>How:</i> The user will type in the information. The error message and help centre will be a separate window.
