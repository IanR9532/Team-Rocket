            <h2><span>1 Introduction</span></h2>
            <p>The Pokémon Encyclopedia (“the project”, “the software”) is a third party database created for the access
              of information on generation I Pokémon. The purpose of this application is to give Pokémon players access
              to a greater depth of information on Pokémon that is not provided by the in-game Pokédex. This
              encyclopedia will be a guide for players who aims for completion rather than the be all and end all. Vital
              information like base stats, in-game locations, type effectiveness, natures, and learnset is not provided
              by other online encyclopedias. The Pokémon Encyclopedia strives to provide this information to allow the
              players to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game. </p>

                  <h5><span>1.1.1 Purpose</span></h5>
                  <p> The purpose of this project is to provide Pokémon players with a comprehensive database of
                    relevant information to allow them to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the
                    game. Specifically, how they can optimize their Pokémon teams based on information our application
                    provides. </p>

                  <h5><span>1.1.2 Scope</span></h5>
                  <p> We aim to have all 151 generation I Pokémon in our database, along with the following information
                    which has already been provided by the ingame Pokédex: name, description, type(s), height, weight,
                    brief biography description. As well as additional information that is relevant but not provided
                    in-game: abilities, catch rate, type match ups, leveling-rate, EV yield. As well, we would like to
                    have a user account system using a password hashing algorithm to store passwords. Users will be able
                    to save information to their account. </p>

                  <h5><span>1.1.3 Assumptions and Constraints</span></h5>
                  <p> The biggest constraint on this project will be time. We have a set timeline to accomplish the
                    objectives we have declared. Furthermore, our understanding of the software we have available to us
                    may be another limitation. It's possible that members will have to learn how to use this software
                    before being able to implement the objectives. Another constraint is acquiring Pokémon data. We will
                    need to find a source with all this information, otherwise entering this information in manually
                    will be repetitive. </p>

            <h2><span>3 Definitions</span></h2><br />
            <div id="3_definitionss">
              <p><u><b>Move</b></u>: A move, also known as an attack is the skill Pokémon primarily use in battle.</p>
              <p><u><b>Type</b></u>: Pokémon and the different moves they can use are all classified by properties
                called Types. A Pokémon can be associated with one or two types whereas a move can only be associated
                with one type. Moves that deal damage to other Pokémon can have more of an effect, a neutral level of
                effectiveness, less of an effect, or no effect at all, based on their type and the type of the Pokémon
                they are being used against. An example of an effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move
                against a Grass type Pokémon. An example of a less effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type
                move against a Water type Pokémon. Finally, an example of a move which would have no effect at all would
                be a Ghost type move being used against a Normal type Pokémon. </p>
              <p><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: An Ability is a game mechanic that provides a passive effect in battle or in
                the overworld. Individual Pokémon may have only one Ability at a time. Not every Ability is entirely
                beneficial; some of them are hindering.</p>
              <p><u><b>Catch rate</b></u>: Each species of Pokémon has a catch rate that applies to all its members.
                When a Poké Ball is thrown at a wild Pokémon, the game uses that Pokémon's catch rate in a formula to
                determine the chances of catching that Pokémon. Higher catch rates mean that the Pokémon is easier to
                catch, up to a maximum of 255.</p>
              <p><u><b>Type matchup chart</b></u>: A type chart, also known as type matchup chart, shows which modifiers
                are applied to move types when attacking Pokémon of each type.</p>
              <p><u><b>EV yield</b></u>: When a Pokémon is defeated in battle, it will give effort values to the Pokémon
                that participated in the battle against it.</p>

              <h4><span>4.1 Product Perspective</span></h4>
              <p>There will be two major components to this application, front-end and back-end.</p>
              <p>Front-end will deal with the user experience/interface. The goal is to create a GUI that is pleasant
                and easy to use. The GUI will be appealing; images of the Pokémon will be included as well as having the
                text information placed appropriately. Ideally we would like to have a search function that will be able
                to communicate with the backend.</p>
              <p>Back-end will deal with the information stored in the database. The goal will be to create a
                comprehensive database with all the information that we would like to have for each Pokémon object. The
                objects in this database will remain static; unless we make plans to add further generations of Pokémon
                to this project, we will not have features to add new Pokémon. Clean information retrieval is key to
                this project.</p>

              <p>To accomplish all the project requirements, we will divide ourselves into groups and each group will be
                responsible for completing certain tasks. One person from the group will be responsible for
                communicating with the rest of the team and making their work available for the rest of the team. There
                will be a testing team who will work on testing the implementation and assure that the application will
                be able to work properly for any possible case. The members who were a part of implementation will not
                be a part of the testing team. </p>

                <p> For this project, we are working with a team of 16 members. We plan on dividing ourselves into
                  smaller groups based on skill level and interest to work on different aspects of the project such as
                  design, prototyping and implementation. There are two documentation, Requirement Document and SPMP
                  that need to be worked on and updated as we go.</p>
                <p> A small group of the team members who are interested in preparing the documentation will be
                  responsible for the documentation. At least one of the members should be experienced with HTML and
                  take the responsibility of creating the document through HTML. As per the analysis and design, both
                  must be object-oriented and so the team members working on these should have a fair amount of
                  knowledge on object-orientated programming or are willing to learn it in the given time frame.</p>
                <p> For prototyping, a small group of the team members will be responsible for designing the looks for
                  this application and creating options for how the users can interact with the application. At least
                  one person should be familiar with UX design and Figma, overall, everyone should be willing to learn
                  about the UI development process and work with a creative mind set. For front and back end, the
                  members responsible should be experienced with the languages being used (mentioned below in section <a
                    href="#6.2">6.2</a>). They should also be willing to put in sometime to learn new material that may
                  be required for the implementation. The testing crew will be members of the team that have not worked
                  on the implementation. They should be able to consider all possible cases that might occur when other
                  users start using the application and make sure the application is capable of handling the cases. </p>

                    be a few steps to take before any changes are made. First we have to consider how the change will
                    impact the product and will it be impacted positively or negatively? The next step is to think about
                    how many changes will be needed based on the new requirements, how large are these changes and do we
                    have enough time to implement these changes? Lastly, are we capable of implementing such changes
                    based on our skill level. Once these questions are answered, as a team we will decide if we should
                    go forward with the change or not. </p>

                    will be ahead of the actual due date. Within the main tasks we will create subtasks and will have a
                    due date for each subtask. Along with the due date, we will have a due date two for each sub task as
                    well which will be the final deadline for that subtask. The first due date will not be a hard due
                    date. </p>

                    individual feature as it is developed. The whole team will have the responsibility of looking for
                    bugs in the code, reporting the bugs, and working together to eliminate these bugs. To keep track of
                    the bugs there will be a bug tracking spreadsheet where each bug will be reported, where to find the
                    bug in the code, the importance of the bug being fixed, and how to reproduce the bug. </p>

              <p> The flow of information will be controlled via Discord. Each work group, assigned to a specific
                activity, will have a dedicated text conversation in which the news, updates, changes, and other
                information related to that activity will be disseminated.
              <p>The project is initially linear with respect to the flow of work products and relationships between
                activities. Each deliverable forms its own work activity and group. The first five deliverables will be
                completed sequentially, and each subsequent activity will begin immediately after the previous one ends.
                However, after the prototype is created, the front-end and back-end work activities can be done
                simultaneously. Furthermore, testing on code for both activities can be completed as required while
                other sections are in-progress.</p>
              <p> Upon completion of the first five work activities, each section of that activity should be reviewed
                and approved by at least two other group members. For the front-end and back-end activities, the testing
                work activity will act as review and approval for the actual implementation.</p>

              <h4><span>7.1 Verification and validation plan</span></h4>
              <p> Verification and validation is an important step for any project to go to a stable state. A stable
                state is when a program has been tested and validated as bug free. This state is where it has
                successfully completed specific requirements for the project.</p>
              <p> Throughout the project, the team will test for bugs as developers work. All bugs will be reported to
                the bug tracking system with a report on where the bug is located and replication of the bug. When the
                project finishes their tasks for the current version (of project), it will then proceed to the
                verification and validation phase. </p>
              <p> Our verification and validation plan is a process of steps. </p>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>Complete the current requirements for the current version of the software.</li>
                <li>Members from front-end and back-end will verify the completion of the current version.</li>
                <li>Make an announcement to the group members that the software is completed for testing.</li>
                <li>Group members will test the software from the front-end and report bugs, and present a report on how
                  to replicate it.</li>
                <li>Group members will analyze the back-end code for any missing documentation and mark down for fix.
                </li>
                <li>Developers will fix any major software-breaking bugs.</li>
                <li>Front-end and back-end developers will have a quick meeting to agree on finalizing the current
                  version of the software.</li>
                <li>Once finalized and validated, developers will set the current version as a stable version.</li>

              <h4><span>7.2 Documentation plan</span></h4>
              <p> Documentation is an important process when handling code. It is important when it comes to coding as
                it gives a short and concise description of what the code does. This is beneficial for other developers
                when they use another developer’s code. Documentation not only benefits you as a developer, but your
                peers, and future developers of the project.</p>
              <p> Our plan for documenting our project, we agreed that we have requirements when documenting. Bellow are
                the requirements when documenting any code </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Name of author of the function/class/etc.</li>
                <li>Date of creation by the author of the function/class/etc.</li>
                <li>Description of what the function/class/etc. does</li>
                <li>List any used parameters/returns and put a description of their usage and variable types</li>
                <li>Name of editor who last modified code</li>
                <li>Date of edit by the editor who last modified code</li>

              <h4><span>7.3 Quality assurance plan</span></h4>
              <p> Quality assurance is key to creating a quality final product. In order to succeed in that we have a
                plan to ensure that we create the best Pokémon Encyclopedia we can. The most important step in this
                process is making sure each member of the group looks at and approves of each stage in this project.
                That means proper coding practices and style, good informative documentation as well as general software
                development practices. Each member should have a good grasp of most of the basic level parts of this
                project and be able to identify where the project should be improved or changed. A practice that will
                help us achieve this is having each member look over the particular part of this project that is due and
                coming to meetings with constructive criticism to help improve the overall quality of the project. As a
                final step that should be standard is that everyone will test the various aspects of the project. This
                will help catch any obscure errors or bugs that might not have been caught by the programmer who wrote
                the code in the first place. The combination of all of these processes will help develop a high quality
                final product. </p>
